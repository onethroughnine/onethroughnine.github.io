Like the last few years, we — Rahmy, Layla, and Summer — have spent a week together in December, playing cards and enjoying an unseasonably warm winter. Spread across the country and each leading distinct lives, we relish that we get to do the same things every year: we go to the arcade, drink tea at the local Yemeni coffee house, bake cookies, and this year through no fault of our own we did not go sledding.</description>
