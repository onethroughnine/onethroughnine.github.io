Welcome to One Through Nine, 

Like the last few years, we — Rahmy, Layla, and Summer — have spent a week together in December, playing cards and enjoying an unseasonably warm winter. Spread across the country and each leading distinct lives, we relish that we get to do the same things every year: we go to the arcade, drink tea at the local Yemeni coffee house, bake cookies, and this year through no fault of our own we did not go sledding. But most of all, we spend our time talking to each other and our friends about everything and anything.

Through various hours of games, chats and eats we stumbled upon the idea of starting our very own blog. Our friends and family were definitely not expecting us to do this and they frequently asked us why rip? We found the thought too exciting, too delightful, to resist. 

With the onslaught of incoming questions we found ourselves actually thinking about what this blog would be about. The answer was simple: keep the ball moving. Sometimes, we find ourselves wishing there was more space in our lives for intentional connection, for long conversations, the same way we make intentional space for other things in our professional and personal lives. This is our way to stay talking, stay connected and overall encourage us to stay thinking. 

Let’s do this thing, 

Rahmy, Layla and Summer
